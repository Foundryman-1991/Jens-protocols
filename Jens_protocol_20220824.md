## Learn what problems to solve or - 
## __What questions need to be asked to finally solve the problem as a data analysist__
# 1. Prioritising: 
* Choosing which problems to Solve, using prioritising with Pareto Analysis, "80-20 rule: 80% of the consequences originate from only 20% of causes
# 2. Analytics Workflow

# 3. Root Cause Analysis:
 * Root cause analysis in general is an important step to enable data analysts for understanding of the problem:
 * "5 WHYS": The 5-WHY method, is a method for cause-effect determination. The aim is to determine a cause for a problem. Ask this question as often as necessary until the problemâ€™s real root cause is identified. This may take fewer or more times than 5 WHYS. 
 
 * Root cause Analysis Tree Diagram:The diagram displays the structure of causes for a factor, it can map levels of details of tasks that are required to accomplish a goal or solution or task.
 
 * Fish Bone analysis: Identification of the possible influencing factors, targeted questions: "What exactly in the (category: e.g. equipment, process) might have an impact on the problem?"

 * The goal is to list as many influencing factors as possible. The more influencing factors are listed, the greater the chance that the factors relevant

# 4. Finally find the scope of solution:
  * Map the upstream and downstream processes:
  
    - Where in the task matrix is the stakeholder trying to get help
    - Input, Training, Feedback, Judgement, Prediction?
    - Asking about what stakeholder will do with the results will help unlock this

   * Asking about what stakeholder will do with the results will help unlock this
   
     - Increase the value of your work by moving up the Pyramid

# Descriptive statistics:
  * Today's focus on: 
    - Lay the foundation of statistical concepts
    - Gain understanding of more advanced statistical techniques
    - Introduction to the basic charts used to display statistics

  * Today's topics: 
    - Types of Data
    - Basic aggregation
    - Measures of Central Tendency
    - Measures of Variation
    - Frequency distributions
